All files can be found in the "dataset" directory.

**Exercise 8**  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
1. Create a nested dataframe of df1. Specifically only of the two largest groups by common_name, and nest by the common_name. 
2. Create a linear model between length_mm and IGF1_ng_ml using purrr over the nested dataframe. Add the results back to the dataframe
3. Create a new nested variable containing projections for length_mm based on your linear model (the function *predict* will be helpful here).
