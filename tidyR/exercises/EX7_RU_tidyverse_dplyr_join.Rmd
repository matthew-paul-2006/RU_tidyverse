**Exercise 7**  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
* Calculate CPMs and TPMs for our expressed genes (tidy_counts_expressed)

Hint:

**Counts per million (CPM)** are the gene counts normalized to total counts in a sample, multiplied by a million to give you a sensible number.  

gene_A_CPM = (gene_A_counts / sum(all_genes_counts)) * 1,000,000

**Transcripts per million (TPM)** are the gene counts normalized to total counts in a sample, multiplied by a million to give you a sensible number.  

gene_A_TPM = (gene_A_counts / sum(all_genes_counts / all_genes_lengths)) * 1/gene_A_length * 1,000,000
